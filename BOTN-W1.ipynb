    "Melbourne is the capitol of Victoria, Australia. The Economist Intelligence Unit's 2017 Global Liveability Index awarded Melbourne as the world's top city for seven years running. Currently Melbourne is the second most livable city, toppled by Vienna (Austria) to be the top liveable city in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Melbourne is very academic and a creative city home to world-class academics and an exciting entrepreneurial spirit, if you study in Melbourne you will soon be thinking outside the box (and around it, above it and below it, too). Melbourneâ€™s winding alleyways are magical, they will probably make you feel as though you have stepped into a real-life Wonderland. Melbourne is a melting pot of communities and is home to many different cultural celebrations. Currently, 3500 to 4000 people enter Victoria each year under the Humanitarian Program for refugees and others in refugee-like situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this means the Melbourne's market is highly competitive. For someone moving to Melbourne or Victoria, it is important to understand safe and comfortable places to live. Or, even for people moving within Victoria, having the insights around crime and safety would mean a good and comfortable move. "

    "The idea for this project is to show insights driven using venue and location data from FourSquare, backed up with open source crime data from Crime Statistics Victoria (https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/). We can enable the users of this project to not only choose the safest suburb, but also the safest suburb with the right amenities. We will use maps from FourSquare to present the findings. \n",

    "How will we do this\n",
    "1. Use data from FourSquare to find the top venues in Melbourne/Victoria\n",
    "2. Augument this data with crime data around those venues\n",
    "3. Maps are presented to users and suburbs/venues can be used"
